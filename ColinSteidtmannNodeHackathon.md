**I'd love to join a team!** 
 
I believe that I can contribute to the development of the smart contracts & basic front-end application, as well as contributing well-thought ideas. I may struggle with the UI/UX design as well as some of the advanced programming. In addition to specific knowledge writing smart contracts that interact with the Chainlink oracle provider, I am familiar working with: Hardhat, Solidity, Ethers.js, Chai-Waffle & Mocha, React/Next.js, & Typescript. 

**About me**

I'm Colin and I go to Berkeley City College where I  study programming & electrical engineering. I got interested in blockchain technology and programming ethereum smart contracts last spring. I've hacked together a few dApps (most recently last Fall) and have won a few hackathon prizes for them (can be viewed on my Devpost profile [@colinsteidtmann](devpost.com/colinsteidtmann)). Beginning in 2022, I took a break from the blockchain world to instead focus on studying C++ & Assembly language programming. I am now easing back into the blockchain world, starting with this hackathon. 

**My hackathon ideas**

**1.)** *Decentralized health insurance for bike racer. Niche market but strong demand.* 

**2.)** *NFT financial Options for physical products/services. Eg: NFT Option for a Water Heater.* 

*Problem it solves* (example): Real Estate owners who need more financial certainty. If you own property, then you'll know that feeling when a tenant calls to tell you that the water heater, washing machine, stove, dishwasher, etc broke. Or that the roof is leaking. These inconvenient & expensive occurrences could've been somewhat planned for, but not very accurately. *The solution*: buy a NFT option that gives you the right to buy a _______ at a stated price _____ within the specified period ___________. Transfer the option if you no longer need it. Sell the initial option if you happen to own a Home Depots store or something. 

**3.)** Independent company/organization that explains the terms, conditions, and risks of a specific smart contract to an average consumer

**4.)** *Inflation adjusted salary based on an employee's specific "basked of goods."*

*Problem it solves*: The national inflation rate doesn't represent the inflation I (or you) experience. It's based on a broad basket of goods. *Solution*: Let employees pick all the goods and services **they** consume, and add them to a decentralized smart contract that will automatically adjust their salary based on the prices of those goods. 

**5.)** *Bet on people*

*Problem it solves*, example: Poker players need a lot of cash when they enter tournaments. They'll usually partner with other players, pool together some funding, and divide any winnings. Smart contracts and a ledger that tracks how well a poker player performs, could provide everyone access to betting on humans/performers, and share in their jackpot winnings. 

**6.)** *Storage for sentimental/expensive physical items, w/ownership rights represented by NFT*

*Problem it solves*, example: I have a small item that my Grandma gave me. I don't want to get rid of it but I also hate lugging it around every time I move. I don't need a full storage container. I'd love to get it scanned, stored somewhere secure, and receive an NFT that represents my rights to retrieve it any time. -----Another example: A shoe collector has a few shoes worth some $$$ but they don't want to store them at home anymore. A storage container would be too large. They also may want to sell the shoes at any given moment. They'd like to store the shoes somewhere secure & receive an NFT digital version that gives them the right to access their shoes at any time or sell/transfer ownership rights to another person. 

Can't wait to participate in this hackathon, meet people, learning something new, and contribute to building a great project!
